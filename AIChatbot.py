# The base of this program comes from this video https://youtu.be/CkkjXTER2KE?si=oQ6ga19D9s1fTZh8
# My modifications:
# -Gave the chatbot a database of dialouge it can pick from (so the user doesn't have to enter every answer in manually)
# -Gave the user the ability to overwrite the chatbot's saved answers
# -Adjusted the accuracy of the answers
# With these modifications, the chatbot should have responses to many basic questions
